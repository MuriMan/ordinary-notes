\subsection{Number Systems}
The number system consisting of digits 0 through 9 is called the denary or decimal system
(10 digits). Computers use another number system called binary, consisting of digits
0 through 1. This is done such that computers are able to pass the data through logic 
gates and can be stored in registers.

The number of digits in a number system is the base of that system; denary is base ten;
binary is base two; hexadecimal is base 16.

\subsubsection*{Conversions}
From positive denary to positive binary:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Perform short division on given denary number, taking note of the remainders.
	\item Write the remainders from bottom to top, resulting in the binary number.
\end{enumerate}
From positive binary to positive denary:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Write the binary number with their \textit{place powers} .
	\item Sum the products of each binary digit with the place power, resulting in the
		converted denary number.
	\item Write the remainders from bottom to top, resulting in the binary number.
\end{enumerate}
From positive denary to positive hexadecimal:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Convert given number to binary
	\item Split resulting binary number to four-bit parts.
	\item Convert the four-bit binaries to denary.
	\item 1 = 1; 2 = 2; ... 10 = A; 11 = B; 12 = C; 13 = D; 14 = E; 15 = F.
	\item Arrange resulting digits side-by-side.
\end{enumerate}
From positive hexadecimal to positive denary:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Convert each given hex number to denary using the index in step 4 of 
		denary-hex.
	\item Convert each denary number to binary.
	\item Arrange the resulting four-bit binary pieces, producing binary result.
\end{enumerate}
From positive hexadecimal to positive binary:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Convert to denary.
	\item Convert to binary.
\end{enumerate}
From positive binary to positive hexadecimal:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Convert to binary.
	\item Convert to denary.
\end{enumerate}
