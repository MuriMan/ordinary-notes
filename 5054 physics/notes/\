\section{Motion, forces and energy}
\subsection{Physical quantities and measurement techniques}

Lengths can be measured using measuring tapes, rulers and micrometers.

A measuring cylinder can be used to find the volume of an irregularly shaped object. A volume
of liquid will first be taken in the measuring cylinder, which must fit the irregular object in
question. The object will then be submerged into the liquid, and we will measure the change in
volume reading of the liquid. For this case, note that $\SI{1}{cm^3} = \SI{1}{ml}$.

A scalar quantity has only a magnitude, and a vector quantity has magnitude and a direction related
with that magnitude. Vector quantities will be denoted in this text as $\vec{x}$. Some scalar
quantities are that of: distance, speed, time, mass, energy, and temperature. Some vector 
quantities follow: displacement, force, weight, velocity, acceleration, momentum, electric field
strength and gravitational field strength.

Vectors are represented as arrows pointing in space. Those arrows have a direction, and a length,
corresponding to the direction and magnitude of the quantity being represented by the arrows.

    \draw[thick, ->] (0,0) -- (3,0) node[midway, below]{$\vec{B}$};
	\draw[thick, ->] (0,0) -- (0,3) node[midway, left]{$\vec{A}$};
	\draw[thick, ->, dashed] (0,0) -- (3,3) node[midway, right]{$\vec{A} + \vec{B}$};

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}
The above diagram shows two vectors: $\vec{A}$ and $\vec{B}$ and their resultant vector or their 
sum: $\vec{A} + \vec{B}$. To find the magnitude of their sum, or $\left|\vec{A} + \vec{B}\right|$,
we can utilise the Pythagorean theorem:

$$\left|\vec{A} + \vec{B}\right| = \sqrt{ \left|\vec{A}\right|^2 + \left|\vec{B}\right|^2 }$$

\subsection{Motion}
Speed is the distance travelled by an object per unit time, and velocity is the change in 
displacement of an object per unit time. The displacement of an object is how far it is from a
given origin point. This results in the following equation:

$$ v = \frac{s}{t} $$
$$ \vec{v} = \frac{\vec{s}}{t} $$
where $s$ is displacement or distance, given the context, $v$ is velocity or speed respectively and
$t$ is time taken to cause the corresponding change in displacement or to travel $s$ distance.

The average speed of an object is given by the total distance it travelled over the total time it
took:
$$ \textrm{average speed} = \frac{\textrm{total distance travelled}}{\textrm{time taken}} $$

Acceleration is a vector which is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time, as seen in 
the equation:
$$\textrm{acceleration, } a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $$

Uniform acceleration arises when the value of acceleration is unchanging. It causes a linear 
change in velocity with change in time, as seen in:
$$ \Delta v = a (\Delta t) $$
A non-constant, i.e. changing value of acceleration results in a non-linear change in velocity, as
seen by the same equation if the values of $a$ is different for values of $t$.

A deceleration is simply negative acceleration, negative acceleration causes decrease in velocity.
A deceleration of \SI{9}{ms^{-2}} is equivalent to an acceleration of \SI{-9}{ms^{-2}}.

The values of speed, distance and velocity can all be plotted against time to see graphically, the
relationships between all these variables.

\end{center}
In the above graph, a stopwatch is started at time, $t = \SI{0}{s}$. The velocity of an object
is measured at certain time intervals, using the data from which, the graph is drawn. 

For 
$0 \le t \le t_1$, the graph shows a straight line. This means that the gradient of the curve must
be constant. By definition, acceleration is the gradient of velocity with respect to time since
it is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time. So a straight line in a $v$-$t$ curve
shows that acceleration is constant, i.e., uniform. Otherwise, the acceleration can be said to be
non-uniform. For $t_1 \le t \le t_2$, the line is parallel to the horizontal axis. This means the
gradient, $a$, equals 0. Note that, the area under a $v$-$t$ graph gives distance or displacement,
given context, since the product of the units of the axes, \SI{}{(ms^{-1})(s)} = \SI{}{m}, gives
the unit of distance. Lastly, $t_2 \le t \le t_3$ is a downward sloping line, meaning the 
acceleration is negative, and negative acceleration is decleration.

distance-time, $s$-$t$, graph.
\end{center}
In the above graph, the distance travelled by an object from time, $t=0$ has been measured and
plotted. Note that, the gradient of this curve is the speed of the object, and the area under it
is nonsense.

Thus, for $0 \le t \le t_1$, the car travels with a constant positive 
speed and its distance 
travelled increases.

For $t_1 \le t \le t_2$, no more distance is travelled, meaning the object is stationary.

For $t_2 \le t \le t_3$, the object travels with a decreasing decreasing speed, meaning that the
object is moving with a decreasing speed, i.e., it is decelerating.

For an object close to the surface of the earth, when they are in free fall, they are affected by
a constant acceleration, $g = \SI{9.8}{m/s^2}$.

\subsection{Mass and weight}

Mass is a measure of the quantity of an object at rest relative to the observer. It is this 
property of an object that resists change from its state of motion, be it rest or motion. This
resistance of motion is called the inertia of that object, the measure of the stationary inertia of
an object is its mass.

Gravitational field strength is a property unique to each gravitational field. It is the force
each unit of mass experiences in the gravitational field, as follows:
$$ g = \frac{W}{m} $$
where $g$ is the gravitational field strength, in \SI{}{N/kg}, $W$ is the weight of an object, i.e.,
the force experienced by it due to gravity, and $m$ is its mass.

A gravitational field is a region in space in which a mass experiences a force due to gravitational
attraction.

\subsection{Density}

Density is the mass per unit volume of an object, as follows:
$$ \rho = \frac{m}{V} $$
where $\rho$ is the density and $V$ is the volume of the object. To find the density of an 
irregularly shaped object, we can use the strategy discussed at the beginning of Section 1 and
measure its mass, finally plugging those readings into the above formula.

\subsection{Forces}
\subsubsection{Balanced and unbalanced forces}
A force is simply a push or pull, or, more scientifically, a force is an acceleration on a mass.
There are many kinds of force; weight, friction, drag, air resistance, tension (elastic), 
electrostatic, magnetic, thrust, contact etc.

Diagrams can be drawn to show the forces acting on an object:

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Draw the point mass
    \filldraw[black] (0,0) circle (2pt) node[below] {$A$};

    % Draw the force arrows
    \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (-2,0) node[left] {$F_1$}; % Force F1 to the left
    \draw[->, thick] (0,0) -- (2,0) node[right] {$F_2$};  % Force F2 to the right

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The above diagram shows a particle $A$, which is experiencing forces in opposite directions, 
denoted by the arrows, $F_1$ and $F_2$. By the length of the arrows, we can say that the 
magnitudes of the forces is equal, i.e. $\left|F_1\right| = \left|F_2\right|$\footnote{$\left|\vec{x}\right|$
gives the magnitude of $\vec{x}$.}.

Newton's first law follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
An object either remains at rest or continues motion in a straight line at constant speed unless
acted on by a resultant force.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

A force causes an acceleration on a mass, this acceleration may change the magnitude of the object's
velocity, i.e., its speed or it may change the direction of its velocity.

If there are multiple forces acting along the same axis, we will consider all the forces in one
direction to be one sign, and consider the rest of the forces in the opposite direction to be
an opposite sign. Consider an object has $n$ forces acting to the right, and $m$ forces acting to
the left. Let's have the forces to the right have a positive sign, we must then have the forces to
the left have a negative sign. The resultant of the forces on the object will then be:

$$ (F_1 + F_2 + ... + F_n) - (F_1 + F_2 + ... + F_m) $$
$$ \sum_{i=0}^{n}{F_i} - \sum_{k=0}^{m}{F_k} $$

Now, the resultant force, $\sum{F}$, on an object is the product of its mass and its acceleration:
$$ \sum{F} = ma $$

Newton's third law follows:
\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
When object $A$ exerts a force on $B$, then $B$ exerts an equal opposite force on $A$.
\end{minipage}
\end{center}
This law describes pairs of forces of the same type acting on different objects.

\subsubsection{Friction}

Friction is any force that impedes motion and produces heating.

In a perfect world, friction and such forces do not exist. Motion is not impeded. In such cases,
forces cause objects to move with a constant acceleration, and this happens until or unless another
resultant forces causes it to change. However, when friction or drag\footnote{Simply another form
of friction.} is present, that constant acceleration is no longer constant, and it changes as the
object moves, which may finally result in the object becoming stationary.

Let's consider the case of an object in free fall, where its motion is impeded by air particles.
As it begins its free fall, its acceleration is maximum. As its motion continues, the resistive
force against its motion increases and at a point these forces equal. At that point, acceleration
of the object equals zero, the object continues its motion at a constant velocity, this is called
the terminal velocity of the object. The following graphs illustrate this situation:

\begin{minipage}{0.6\textwidth}
\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    % Axes
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (5,0) node[right] {$t$};  % Time axis
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,3) node[above] {$a$}; % Acceleration axis
    
    % Label terminal velocity point
    \draw[dashed] (4,0) node[below] {$t_1$}; % Terminal velocity at t_1
    
    % Draw the acceleration curve
    \draw[thick] (0, 2) sin (4, 0); % Curve approaching terminal velocity
    \draw[thick] (4, 0) -- (4.5, 0); % Curve approaching terminal velocity

	\draw (0, 0) node[below] { $O$ };
    
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{tikzpicture}
	\draw (0, 0) node[below] { $O$ };
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (5,0) node[right] {$t$};  % Time axis
    \draw[->] (0,0) -- (0,3) node[above] {$v$}; % Acceleration axis

	\draw[thick] (0, 0) sin (3, 2);
	\draw[dashed] (3, 2) -- (3, 0) node[below]{$t_1$};
	\draw[dashed] (4, 2) -- (4, 0) node[below]{$t_2$};
	\draw[thick] (3, 2) -- (4, 2);
\end{tikzpicture}

\end{center}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
To the left are the $a$-$t$ and $v$-$t$ graphs of an object in free fall which eventually
reaches terminal velocity. Notice that by $t_1$, the acceleration of the object reaches 0,
and so the velocity of the object also becomes constant $t_1$. For $t_1 \le t \le t_2$, the
object travels at terminal velocity.
\end{minipage}
