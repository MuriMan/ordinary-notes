\subsection{Coordination and response in plants}
Gravitropism is a response in which parts of a plant grow towards or away from gravity (positive
and negative gravitropism, respectively). Phototropism is the same only with light.

Auxin is a hormone that is produced in the shoot tip of a plant and diffuses downward through the
plant. The production of auxin is stimulated when light hits the shoot tip.

It stimulates cell elongation and is unequally distributed in response to light and gravity.
Specifically, it diffuses away from light and towards gravity. Hence the plant roots elongate 
downward
into the soil and bend toward light.

Shoots are positively phototrophic and negatively gravitrophic, the opposite applies for roots.
