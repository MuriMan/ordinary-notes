\section{Organic chemistry}
\subsection{Formulae, functional groups and terminology}
Structural formulae are unambigious descriptions of the way atoms in a molecule are arranged,
showing double bonds between carbon atoms and each molecule bonded to each carbon, eg., 
\ce{CH2=CH2}, \ce{CH3CH2OH}.

Displayed formulae show all the atoms and bonds between them in a molecule. 

The general formulae of homologous series follow:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Alkanes, \ce{CnH{2n+2}}
\end{itemize}
